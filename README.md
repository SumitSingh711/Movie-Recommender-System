<h1> Movie Recommendor system using Streamlit</h1>

[Web Application](https://movie-recommender-system-iklvefy432sbxedwi3ttaz.streamlit.app/)

This project involves creating a movie recommendation system that utilizes a dataset from TMDB (The Movie Database). The system allows users to input their search preferences, and based on these patterns, it efficiently identifies and displays the top 5 related movies from a selection of 5,000 titles. This approach ensures that users receive highly relevant movie suggestions tailored to their specific interests.
